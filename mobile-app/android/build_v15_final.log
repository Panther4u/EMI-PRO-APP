       1.  Dependency 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.7.0' requires libraries and applications that
           depend on it to compile against version 34 or later of the
           Android APIs.
     
           :app is currently compiled against android-33.
     
           Also, the maximum recommended compile SDK version for Android Gradle
           plugin 7.4.2 is 33.
     
           Recommended action: Update this project's version of the Android Gradle
           plugin to one that supports 34, then update this project to use
           compileSdkVerion of at least 34.
     
           Note that updating a library or application's compileSdkVersion (which
           allows newer APIs to be used) can be done separately from updating
           targetSdkVersion (which opts the app in to new runtime behavior) and
           minSdkVersion (which determines which devices the app can be installed
           on).
