           Recommended action: Update this project's version of the Android Gradle
           plugin to one that supports 35, then update this project to use
           compileSdkVerion of at least 35.
     
           Note that updating a library or application's compileSdkVersion (which
           allows newer APIs to be used) can be done separately from updating
           targetSdkVersion (which opts the app in to new runtime behavior) and
           minSdkVersion (which determines which devices the app can be installed
           on).
